# ESG Investment Analysis

## Business Question
I and my team assisted the manager to answer a critical business question: 
"How does the ESG performance of Bayer AG — using both summary KPIs and detailed environmental, social, governance, and financial metrics—compare to competitors and industry benchmarks, and what insights can be drawn about its strengths, weaknesses, and investment potential?"

## Project Process
We have gone through a 4-stage process to address this question:
1. Project Plan
2. Premilinary Analysis & Discovery
3. Story Board
4. Interactive Data Story

## Process in Details
1. Project Plan
