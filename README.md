## üìä Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance for **Bayer AG** within the **pharmaceutical industry**. Leveraging data from the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG), I led my team of 4 analysts to develope a multi-stage analytical approach to understanding the company's sustainability and investment potential.

### üéØ Project Goals

- Evaluate Bayer AG's ESG performance
- Compare performance against industry benchmarks
- Provide actionable insights for sustainable investment decisions

## üîç Methodology

### Data Source
- **Dataset**: LSEG's ESG Performance Dataset
- **Scope**: Curated subset focusing on environmental, social, and governance metrics

### Analytical Stages

Our analysis followed a structured four-stage approach:

1. **Project Planning**
   - Defined and selected 9 critical variables across ESG dimensions
     * Environmental KPIs (3): Renewable Energy, Waste Recycling Ratio, Carbon Intensity
     * Governance KPIs (2): Board Independence, Board Diversity
     * Financial KPIs (4): Market Cap, Revenue, ROA, EBIT
   - Developed preliminary research questions

2. **Preliminary Analysis**
   - Created initial visualizations in Tableau
   - Explored data through multiple chart types:
     * Comparison charts
     * Trend analysis
     * Relationship mapping
     * Distribution analysis
     * Geographical perspectives

3. **Storyboard Development**
   - Organized insights using Dykes' Data Storytelling Arc
   - Refined visualizations
   - Developed narrative structure:
     * Setting and Hook
     * Rising Points
     * Climactic Insight (Aha moment)
     * Resolution

4. **Interactive Data Story**
   - Transformed storyboard into interactive Tableau dashboard
   - Implemented advanced interactive features
   - Enabled dynamic data exploration
     
## üí° Actionable Insights

### Strategic Recommendations

Based on our comprehensive ESG performance analysis, we recommend to **HOLD** and/or **MONITOR** the company's future performance.

1. **ESG Performance vs Financial Reality**
   - **Strong ESG** metrics **haven't translated to market value** (Important)
   - **High carbon intensity** remains a concern
   - Mixed industry ESG-Market Cap relationship indicates **company-specific challenges** ([Monsanto Acquisition](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/worst-deal-ever-bayer-s-market-cap-now-close-to-total-cost-it-paid-for-monsanto))
     
2. **Operational Standing of Bayer AG**
   - Above-average operational metrics but asset utilization needs improvement
   - **Strong governance** despite declining board independence

### Next Steps
3. **Financial Health of Bayer AG**
   - Prioritize **inceasing efficiency in asset utilization**
   - Consider **strategic divestments**

4. **ESG Focus**
   - Target **carbon intensity reduction**
   - Balance board independence while maintaining diversity
   - Use improved ESG performance to **rebuild stakeholder trust**
